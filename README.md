A statistical model-based Voice Activity Detector

A voice activity detector applied a statistical model has been made in [2], where the decision rule is derived from the likelihood ratio test (LRT) by estimating unknown parameters using the decision-directed method. Hang-over scheme based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) are applied for smoothing.

## Run the demo
```bash
python vad.py
```
